# Translator Project

## Description
The Translator Project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) program designed to translate 10 common English sayings and phrases into a chosen language. The program also allows the user to add more translations, view existing translations, edit them, and search for specific translations. The translations are stored in a JSON file for persistence.

The program is built using Python and is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to translate, manage, and expand their collection of translations.
